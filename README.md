# SE1-Airtight-Doors-Hangars-Gates
Repo for SE1 Mod: Airtight Doors, Hangars, &amp; Gates

This *simple* source code enables all vanilla entryways to be airtight.

About two years after release, I discovered the mod requires ownership of all DLC entryways to function. Instead of creating separate versions for each DLC, I'm sharing the mod code and instructions on how to fork it based on the DLCs you own. This repository will be updated [alongside the original mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2970981537) after each update or DLC that introduces a new entryway. 

This guide will show you how to introduce your own fork. For a more detailed introduction to modding SE1 at large, [check out this guide](https://github.com/cdrch/space-engineers-fan-docs/blob/master/modding-introduction/main.md#folder-structure) or [this guide for editing SBC files](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2292841964)
